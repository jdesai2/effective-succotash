# X-Team 56 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks





## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks



## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

We will make sure that we message each other on a daily basis, try to assign
work properly, and help one another out if a situation arises. By messaging
each other, we can keep track of progress and make sure that work is being completed 
on time.
